## Detailed progress
1. [Introduction](introduction.md) (✅)
2. [Installation](installation/index.md) (✅)
   ├─ [Installation](installation/installation.md) (✅; the [NVIDIA part](set-up-gpu), generated by Claude, is yet to be verified, I'm unable to do so because there's no GPU on my work laptop)
   └─ [Updates](installation/updates.md) (✅)
3. [Usage](usage/index.md)
   ├─ [Training](usage/training.md) (content collected from three sources: 1. the original `docs/training.md`, last updated 5 months ago, but it's far from complete; 2. the original `docs/index.md`, but it asks the user to refer to scripts/readme.md; 3. scripts/readme.md, last updated two years ago, could be outdated)
   ├─ [Web service](usage/webservice.md) (content collected from the original `docs/webservice.md` and `webservice/README.md`, being regrouped, updated and expanded)
   ├─ [Gradio demo](usage/gradio.md) (✅; content collected from the original `docs/gradio.md` and `gradio/README.md`, the part about Python setup is prepared by claude and I'm not sure if there's a simpler way, and when I followed the instructions there were always permission issues.)
   └─ [Understanding output](usage/understanding-output.md) (✅; content created by claude)
4. [Questions](questions/index.md)
   ├─ [Troubleshooting](questions/troubleshooting.md) (content collected from the original `docs/index.md`, I added some more and grouped them.)
   ├─ [Contributing](questions/contributing.md) (content copied from the original `docs/index.md`; I only provided a cross reference for opening github issue, because I assume whoever knows what pull requests and forking are about doesn't need any detailed instructions on how to do so.)
   └─ [FAQ](questions/faq.md) (content copied from the original `docs/index.md`)
