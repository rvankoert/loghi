## Tasks
1. establish the rtd site: ✅
2. design the structure: ✅
3. add the navigation pane, display the nested headings, enable the flyout menu, and update the theme: ✅
3. update the pages: ongoing, for details see the following sections
4. provide expected output / screenshots for clarity
5. check if the links all work, and add footnotes for external links
6. update the corresponding README.md files

## Detailed progress
1. [Introduction](introduction.md) (✅)
2. [Installation](installation/index.md) (✅)
   - ├─ [Installation](installation/installation.md) (✅; the [NVIDIA part](installation/installation.md#4-set-up-gpu-acceleration-with-nvidia-optional), generated by Claude, is yet to be verified, I'm unable to do so because there's no GPU on my work laptop)
   - └─ [Updates](installation/updates.md) (✅)
3. [Usage](usage/index.md)
   - ├─ [Training](usage/training.md) (content collected from three sources: 1. the original `docs/training.md`, last updated 5 months ago, but it's far from complete; 2. the original `docs/index.md`, but it asks the user to refer to scripts/readme.md; 3. scripts/readme.md, last updated two years ago, could be outdated)
   - ├─ [Web service](usage/webservice.md) (content collected from the original `docs/webservice.md` and `webservice/README.md`, being regrouped, updated and expanded)
   - ├─ [Gradio demo](usage/gradio.md) (✅; content collected from the original `docs/gradio.md` and `gradio/README.md`, the part about Python setup is prepared by claude and I'm not sure if there's a simpler way, and when I followed the instructions there were always permission issues.)
   - └─ [Understanding output](usage/understanding-output.md) (✅; content created by claude)
4. [Questions](questions/index.md)
   - ├─ [Troubleshooting](questions/troubleshooting.md) (content collected from the original `docs/index.md`, I added some more and (re)grouped them.)
   - ├─ [Contributing](questions/contributing.md) (content copied from the original `docs/index.md`; I only provided a cross reference for opening github issue, because I assume whoever knows what pull requests and forking are about doesn't need any detailed instructions on how to do so.)
   - └─ [FAQ](questions/faq.md) (content copied from the original `docs/index.md`)

## RTD site maintenance
Read the Docs doesn't have a public CLI that allows adding a new version purely from the command line. Therefore, it is always necessary to go to the RTD web dashboard and click `Add version`. Below is GPT's answer to the question. 

Version management is mainly done in the RTD web dashboard.But there are ways to approximate it with automation, depending on what you want:

1. **How RTD versions are created**

RTD detects versions automatically from your Git repo:

- Branches: Any branch you push to GitHub can be built as a version.You just need to enable the branch in RTD dashboard once.
- Tags: Any Git tag pushed to GitHub can become a version. RTD will automatically promote the highest tag to stable. Older tags show as inactive versions (unless enabled manually).

✅ Key point: RTD builds versions based on Git refs — no dashboard interaction is required to create the version itself if the tag or branch is pushed.

2. **Command-line “version creation”**

From the CLI you can:

- Create a tag in Git:

```bash
git tag v1.2.0
git push origin v1.2.0
```
This automatically makes v1.2.0 visible to RTD (it will appear in the Versions tab). If it’s the highest tag, RTD makes it stable.

- Create a branch in Git:

```bash
git checkout -b attempt
git push origin attempt
```
RTD will eventually detect it. You may need to enable it once in the dashboard.

⚠️ Limitation

You cannot fully bypass the dashboard to activate a branch/tag if it’s not the “latest” or “stable” automatically.

Some teams use RTD API to automate enabling versions.

3. **RTD API (optional automation)**

Read the Docs has a REST API (requires a token) that allows you to:
- List versions
- Activate/deactivate versions
- Trigger builds

Example (Python, using requests):

```python
import requests

RTD_TOKEN = "your_api_token"
PROJECT_SLUG = "my-project"
VERSION = "v1.2.0"

url = f"https://readthedocs.org/api/v3/projects/{PROJECT_SLUG}/versions/{VERSION}/"

headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Token {RTD_TOKEN}"
}

# Activate version
response = requests.patch(url, headers=headers, json={"active": True})
print(response.status_code, response.json())
```
You still need the tag pushed first. The API just activates the version in RTD, so it shows up in the flyout.
