## Tasks
1. establish the rtd site: ✅
2. design the structure: ✅
3. add the navigation pane, display the nested headings, enable the flyout menu, and update the theme: ✅
3. update the pages: 🟡 ongoing, for details see [Detailed progress](#detailed-progress)
4. check if the links all work, and adapt to reference-style links ✅
5. provide expected output / screenshots for clarity: 🔲 to be done
6. update the corresponding README.md files in the main and sub-directories: 🔲 to be done

## Detailed progress
1. [Introduction](introduction.md) (✅)
2. [Installation](installation/index.md) (✅)
   - ├─ [Installation](installation/installation.md) (✅; the [NVIDIA part](installation/installation.md#4-set-up-gpu-acceleration-with-nvidia-optional), generated by Claude, is yet to be verified, I'm unable to do so because there's no GPU on my work laptop)
   - └─ [Updates](installation/updates.md) (✅)
3. [Usage](usage/index.md)
   - ├─ [Training](usage/training.md) (🟡; content collected from three sources: 1. the original `docs/training.md`, last updated 5 months ago, but it's far from complete; 2. the original `docs/index.md`, but it asks the user to refer to scripts/readme.md; 3. `scripts/readme.md`, last updated two years ago, could be outdated)
   - ├─ [Web service](usage/webservice.md) (🟡; content collected from the original `docs/webservice.md` and `webservice/README.md`, and already updated by claude, but yet to be verified)
   - ├─ [Gradio demo](usage/gradio.md) (✅; content collected from the original `docs/gradio.md` and `gradio/README.md`, the part about Python setup is prepared by claude and I'm not sure if there's a simpler way, and there was a timeout error when I ran the demo)
   - └─ [Understanding output](usage/understanding-output.md) (✅; content created by claude)
4. [Questions](questions/index.md)
   - ├─ [Troubleshooting](questions/troubleshooting.md) (🟡; content collected from the original `docs/index.md`, I added some more and (re)grouped them.)
   - ├─ [Contributing](questions/contributing.md) (✅; content copied from the original `docs/index.md`; I only provided a cross reference for opening github issue, because I assume whoever knows what pull requests and forking are about doesn't need any detailed instructions on how to do so.)
   - └─ [FAQ](questions/faq.md) (✅; content copied from the original `docs/index.md`)

## RTD site maintenance
Read the Docs doesn't have a public CLI that allows adding a new version purely from the command line. Therefore, it is always necessary to go to the RTD web dashboard and click `Add version`. Below is GPT's answer to the question.

> Version management is mainly done in the RTD web dashboard.But there are ways to approximate it with automation, depending on what you want:
>
> 1. **How RTD versions are created**
>
> RTD detects versions automatically from your Git repo:
>
> - Branches: Any branch you push to GitHub can be built as a version.You just need to enable the branch in RTD dashboard once.
> - Tags: Any Git tag pushed to GitHub can become a version. RTD will automatically promote the highest tag to stable. Older tags show as inactive versions (unless enabled manually).
>
> ✅ Key point: RTD builds versions based on Git refs — no dashboard interaction is required to create the version itself if the tag or branch is pushed.
>
> 2. **Command-line “version creation”**
>
> From the CLI you can:
>
> - Create a tag in Git:
>
> ```bash
> git tag v1.2.0
> git push origin v1.2.0
> ```
> This automatically makes v1.2.0 visible to RTD (it will appear in the Versions tab). If it’s the highest tag, RTD makes it stable.
>
> - Create a branch in Git:
>
> ```bash
> git checkout -b attempt
> git push origin attempt
> ```
> RTD will eventually detect it. You may need to enable it once in the dashboard.
>
> ⚠️ Limitation
>
> You cannot fully bypass the dashboard to activate a branch/tag if it’s not the “latest” or “stable” automatically.
>
> Some teams use RTD API to automate enabling versions.
>
> 3. **RTD API (optional automation)**
>
> Read the Docs has a REST API (requires a token) that allows you to:
> - List versions
> - Activate/deactivate versions
> - Trigger builds
>
> Example (Python, using requests):
>
> ```python
> import requests
>
> RTD_TOKEN = "your_api_token"
> PROJECT_SLUG = "my-project"
> VERSION = "v1.2.0"
>
> url = f"https://readthedocs.org/api/v3/projects/{PROJECT_SLUG}/versions/{VERSION}/"
>
> headers = {
>     "Authorization": f"Token {RTD_TOKEN}"
> }
>
> # Activate version
> response = requests.patch(url, headers=headers, json={"active": True})
> print(response.status_code, response.json())
> ```
> You still need the tag pushed first. The API just activates the version in RTD, so it shows up in the flyout.
