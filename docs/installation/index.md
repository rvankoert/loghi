Here is a step-by-step guide for installing Loghi.

## OS requirement
Loghi works best on Linux. Although it can run on Windows using WSL, it is not the recommended approach. Mac's are currently not supported (see also [FAQ](FAQ.md)).

## Problems with installation
If you run into errors, please check the [troubleshooting section](troubleshooting.md). If you still have issues, please open an issue on GitHub with as much detail as possible and make sure to include the error message you received and the version of Loghi. This will help us assist you more effectively.
