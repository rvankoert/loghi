# Installation

Loghi works best on Linux. Although it can run on Windows using WSL, it is not the recommended approach. macOS is currently not supported (see also [FAQ](../questions/FAQ)).

Now we will show you how to install Loghi via the terminal, the place where you send commands to your computer. On a Linux desktop, you can access the terminal by pressing `Ctrl + Alt + T`. Alternatively, you can look for "Terminal" in your applications menu.

```{tip}
Here are some tips that may be useful for those unfamiliar with the terminal and Bash:

1. The usual copy-paste shortcuts, `Ctrl + C` and `Ctrl + V`, don't work in the terminal. Use `Ctrl + Shift + C` and `Ctrl + Shift + V` to copy and paste instead.
2. You can easily get the full path to a folder or file by right-clicking on it in the file manager, selecting `Copy`, and pressing `Ctrl + Shift + V` to paste the full path into the terminal.

For a quick introduction to common commands, you may refer to [Ubuntu's Command Line for Beginners](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners).
