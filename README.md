## Introduction to Loghi

The Loghi framework is designed to streamline the process of Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR), from analyzing document layouts to transcribing handwritten text into digital format. At the core of Loghi are three critical components, each responsible for a distinct aspect of the HTR pipeline:

### Laypa: Layout Analysis and Segmentation

[Laypa](https://github.com/knaw-huc/laypa/) specializes in the segmentation of documents, identifying different regions like paragraphs, page numbers, and most importantly, baselines within the text. Utilizing a sophisticated architecture based on a ResNet backbone and a feature pyramid network, Laypa performs pixel-wise classifications to detect these elements. Built on the [detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2) framework, its output facilitates further processing by converting the classifications into instancesâ€”either as masks or directly into PageXML format. This segmentation is crucial for preparing documents for OCR/HTR processing, ensuring that text regions are accurately recognized and extracted.

### Loghi Tooling: Pre and Post-Processing Toolkit

The [Loghi Tooling](https://github.com/knaw-huc/loghi-tooling) module offers a suite of utilities designed to support the Loghi framework, handling tasks that occur both between and following the machine learning stages. This includes cutting images into individual text lines, integrating the transcription results into the PageXML, and recalculating reading orders among others. Its role is vital in managing the workflow of document preparation and finalization, streamlining the transition from raw image to processed text.

### Loghi HTR: Text Transcription

At the heart of the Loghi framework, the [Loghi HTR](https://github.com/knaw-huc/loghi-htr) module is responsible for the actual transcription of text from images. This system is not limited to handwritten text, as it is also capable of processing machine-printed text. By converting line images into textual data, Loghi HTR forms the final step in the HTR process, bridging the gap between visual data and usable digital text.

Together, these components form a comprehensive ecosystem for handling HTR tasks, from initial layout analysis to the final transcription of text. The Loghi framework offers a modular approach, allowing users to engage with individual components based on their specific needs, while also providing a cohesive solution for end-to-end handwritten text recognition.

## Quick Start

### Installation

Loghi works best on Linux. Although it can run on Windows using WSL, it is not the recommended approach. Mac's are currently not supported.

Begin by cloning the Loghi repository to access the toolkit and navigate into the directory:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:knaw-huc/loghi.git
cd loghi
```

### Docker Images

For most users, Docker offers the easiest and most straightforward way to deploy and use Loghi. Pre-built Docker images contain all the necessary dependencies and can be easily pulled from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/loghi):

```bash
docker pull loghi/docker.laypa
docker pull loghi/docker.htr
docker pull loghi/docker.loghi-tooling
```

If Docker is not installed on your machine, follow [these instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to install it.

But first go to:
https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/YA8HJuukIUKznSP
and download a laypa model (for detection of baselines) and a loghi-htr model (for HTR).

suggestion for laypa:
```text
general
```
suggestion for loghi-htr that should give some results:
```text
generic-2023-02-15
```
It is not perfect, but a good starting point. It should work ok on 17th and 18th century handwritten dutch. For best results always finetune on your own specific data.

edit the [`scripts/inference-pipeline.sh`](scripts/inference-pipeline.sh) using vi, nano, other whatever editor you prefer. We'll use nano in this example

```bash
nano scripts/inference-pipeline.sh
```
Look for the following lines:
```
LAYPABASELINEMODEL=INSERT_FULL_PATH_TO_YAML_HERE
LAYPABASELINEMODELWEIGHTS=INSERT_FULLPATH_TO_PTH_HERE
HTRLOGHIMODEL=INSERT_FULL_PATH_TO_LOGHI_HTR_MODEL_HERE
```
and update those paths with the location of the files you just downloaded. If you downloaded a zip: you should unzip it first.

if you do not have a NVIDIA-GPU and nvidia-docker setup additionally change

```text
GPU=0
```
to
```text
GPU=-1
```
It will then run on CPU, which will be very slow. If you are using the pretrained model and run on CPU: please make sure to download the Loghi-htr model starting with "float32-". This will run faster on CPU than the default mixed_float16 models.

Save the file and run it:
```bash
./scripts/inference-pipeline.sh /PATH_TO_FOLDER_CONTAINING_IMAGES
```
replace /PATH_TO_FOLDER_CONTAINING_IMAGES with a valid directory containing images (.jpg is preferred/tested) directly below it.

The file should run for a short while if you have a good nvidia GPU and nvidia-docker setup. It might be a long while if you just have CPU available. It should work either way, just a lot slower on CPU.

When it finishes without errors a new folder called "page" should be created in the directory with the images. This contains the PageXML output.

### Build dockers from source

As an alternative to using the tested and prebuild docker images, you can build the Docker images with the latest code yourself:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
cd docker
./buildAll.sh
```

### GPU Acceleration

To harness the full power of Loghi for faster processing, running it on a GPU is recommended. For users with NVIDIA GPUs, ensure you have NVIDIA Docker installed or your Docker setup supports GPU acceleration. This allows Loghi to utilize GPU resources for processing tasks, significantly speeding up operations like image segmentation with Laypa and text recognition with Loghi HTR.

Setting up Docker to run with GPU support involves installing NVIDIA's Docker extension and specifying the use of a GPU when running a Docker container. For detailed instructions on enabling Docker to work with your NVIDIA GPU, please refer to the official NVIDIA Docker documentation.

Note: Running Loghi with GPU acceleration is particularly beneficial for processing large datasets or when high throughput is required. Ensure your system meets the necessary hardware and software requirements for optimal performance.

## Using Loghi

For detailed instructions on running inference, training new models, and other advanced features, refer to the [`scripts`](scripts) directory in this repository. There, you'll find sample scripts and a README designed to guide you through these processes efficiently:

- [`create-train-data.sh`](scripts/create-train-data.sh) for preparing training data for HTR models.
- [`generate-synthetic-images.sh`](scripts/generate-synthetic-images.sh) for generating synthetic text lines.
- [`htr-train-pipeline.sh`](scripts/htr-train-pipeline.sh) for training new HTR models.
- [`inference-pipeline.sh`](scripts/inference-pipeline.sh) for transcribing complete scans.

These scripts simplify the process of using Loghi for your HTR projects.

> [!TIP]
> The [Loghi-HTR repository](https://github.com/knaw-huc/loghi-htr/) contains a config folder that provides a few quick-start configurations for running Loghi-HTR. These configurations can be used to quickly set up more advanced training and inference pipelines, allowing you to get started with Loghi-HTR in no time. Simply copy the desired config file, adjust the parameters as needed, and run Loghi-HTR using the `--config_file` parameter.

## FAQ

Here are some frequently asked questions about Loghi and their answers to help you get started and troubleshoot common issues.

### Does Loghi work on Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3)?

Currently, Loghi does not support utilizing Apple Silicon's accelerated hardware capabilities. We understand the importance and potential of supporting this architecture and are actively exploring possibilities to make Loghi compatible with Apple Silicon in the future. For now, users with Apple Silicon devices can run Loghi using emulation or virtualization tools, though this might not leverage the full performance capabilities of the hardware. We appreciate your patience and interest, and we're committed to broadening our hardware support to include these devices.
